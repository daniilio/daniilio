## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniil

I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Applied Statistics at the University of Toronto. My current academic focus is on robotics and operating systems, two topics that really excite me. I'm working on implementing an Autonomous Robot Soccer tournament and a 360Â° LiDAR Scanner (which I hope to use for SLAM applications) at my schoolâ€™s [robotics club](https://robotics-club.utm.utoronto.ca/). In my free time, Iâ€™ve also been building a robot dog, which I hope to finish very soon!
